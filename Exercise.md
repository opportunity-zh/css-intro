          - Set a transform translateX of -12px at 50%
          - Set a transform translateX of 12px at 100%

      - Create a combination class .animate-shake:hover:
        - Add a cursor pointer to the class.

13. Testing and Customization:

    - Test your webpage to ensure it displays as intended.
    - Add classes to the HTML elements to apply the styles you've created or modify the CSS selectors to match the HTML elements.
    - Feel free to customize the content and apply your own creativity while adhering to the provided guidelines.

    Try to accomplish the exercise without looking at the final CSS code provided earlier. Once you've completed the exercise, you can compare your solution to the final CSS code to see how closely you matched the desired styles and animations.
