        As a coder, I find joy in my work. It's like being an artist, but
        instead of paint, I use code to create masterpieces. Every new project
        is a blank canvas, waiting to be transformed. The thrill of coding lies
        in the challenges it presents. Each line of code is a piece of a complex
        puzzle. Debugging is like a detective game, testing patience and
        perseverance. But the triumph when the code finally runs without errors
        is unparalleled.

        CSS classes are used to select the HTML elements we want to style.
        Classes are declared in the HTML element's class attribute. To select an
        element with a specific class, write a dot (.) character, followed by
        the class we declare in the HTML element's class attribute.
      </p>

      <div class="container">
        <div class="box"><h2>First Box</h2></div>
        <div class="box bg-red transform-width"><h2>Second Box</h2></div>
        <div class="box"><h2>Third Box</h2></div>
      </div>

      <div class="container">
        <div id="box-1" class="bg-red">
          <h2>I have the ID box-1</h2>
          <p class="text-size-medium">
            CSS Id selectors are used to select the element with a unique id. To
            select an element with a specific id, write a hash (#) character,
            followed by the id we declare in the HTML element's id attribute.
            Ids are stronger than classes. If an element has both an id and a
            class, the properties of the id will override the properties of the
            class. CSS Ids should always be unique to prevent conflicts or
            strange behavior.

        <div id="box-2">
          <h2>I have the ID box-2</h2>

            CSS element selectors are used to select HTML elements based on the
            element name. To select an element with a specific element name,
            write the element name. Be careful when using element selectors, as
            they select all elements of that type. For example, if you use the
            element selector to select the h2 element, all h2 elements on the
            page will be selected.

          <h2>Inline Styles</h2>
          <p>
            Inline styles are used to style directly on the HTML element. This
            has the highest priority, and will override any other styling.
